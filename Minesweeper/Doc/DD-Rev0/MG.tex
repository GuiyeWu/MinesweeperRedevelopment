\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
This project is to redevelop a classic game minesweeper. The earliest minesweepers trace back to the 1960s, and this puzzle game style becomes popular during the 1980s. In modern time, minesweeper is the built-in game in window 7 system or the earlier version, for any other system it has to be downloaded in order to play this game. The game is very popular in earlier years, however, when the new systems are developed, the game is removed from the built-in games list and many people even don't know about the game nowadays. Our motivation is to renew this project and make it be well known. 
\subsection{Context}
This Module Guide(MG) is created after the Software Requirements Specification(SRS). The Module Guide specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both both designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software. The SRS details all the functional and non-functional requirements for the project. The MG also shows how the software satisfies the functional and non-functional requirements as described in the SRS.
\\\\
When the MG is created, the Module Interaface Specification(MIS) will be created. The MIS will explain the semantics(state and environment variables, assumptions and access routines) and syntax of exported functions(input, output and exceptions) for each module, essentially providing further detail on each module that was specified in the MG.

\subsection{Design Principles}
Information hiding and encapsulation are being used to guide the decomposition of the system into modules in the design principles, as well as the principle that a used relation should contain no cycles, have low coupling and high cohesion.\\\\
The principle of information hiding is that each module hides a secret from the rest of the system. The principle of encapsulation is that the changeable information is in the implementation of the module, but the module interface should not change when the implementation changes. Cycles in the uses relation means that module A uses module B which uses module A. This is considered poor design because it can cause infinite loops. Low coupling means that the modules are independent and do not use many other modules. High cohesion means that the elements within a module are strongly related.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}
The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in the SRS(Software Requirement Specification). In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}. The Minesweeper Module initiates all the mouse action and connects all components together and ensures the program can be executed. The Cell Module creates the input cells and fill them up to the gaming frame. Appearance and usability requirements are satisfied through the Board Module as it deals with what elements are visible to the user and how they will interact with the program. The board module creates a user window that has all of the functions and capability available to user. \\
In order to make our designed easy and intuitive, the game was designed to use buttons for the selections. The buttons are clearly recognizable as to make it easier for the user to understand and make selection. The buttons are used to eliminate the chance of invalid input. The game is easy to install because it will be in an exe file. This means that the game will simply run if they have python and pygame installed on the system. Implementing this project in python also satisfies the requirement that the project should be able to run on different operations systems. In order to satisfy the requirement that the interface should be in position and clearly displayed, the various frame size will popped up based on the user's selection on the button. This ensures that the cells will always be in position. In order to satisfy players needs, the game is being kept simple and rebuilt as its original version as much as possible. This ensure that the flavour and the culture of the game are kept.
\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}
The following modules are decomposed to David Parnas' principle of information hiding. They are broken down in the following matter, \emph{Secret}, \emph{Service} and \emph{Implemented by}. Secret will describe in a single world what it is that the module is hiding. Services will detail what it is the module does and Implemented By states by what means the module is implemented.
