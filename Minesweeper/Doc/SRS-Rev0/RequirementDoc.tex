\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
This project is to redevelop a classic game minesweeper. The earliest minesweepers trace back to the 1960s, and this puzzle game style becomes popular during the 1980s. In modern time, minesweeper is the built-in game in window 7 system or the earlier version, for any other system it has to be downloaded in order to play this game. The game is very popular in earlier years, however, when the new systems are developed, the game is removed from the built-in games list and many people even don't know about the game nowadays. Our motivation is to renew this project and make it be well known.
\subsubsection{Goals of The Project}
The goal of this project is trying to redevelop the classic game -- minesweeper with a new style of the user interface with some funny features to increase the
enjoyment. This game is suitable for the users that would like practice logical thinking skills and being entertained at the same time. With different levels are included in this game, this will increase the playability for users from beginner to expert. The game will be re-implemented in python and can be easily accessed locally once it has been pre-downloaded on the computer. The advantage of this project is to provide our clients with a free-and-easy access minesweeper game whenever and wherever possible.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for our product will be the group of the general public that is interested in playing the new version of minesweeper game. They will also be the reviewer of the product. 
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The customer of the project will a group of the general public which is interested in consuming the game media. The entity, which members can be from all ages, who have the access and interact with our product will be the customer. 
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
People, who have an interest in the game, either tangible or intangible, will be the other stakeholders for this software. 
This group of people may have different knowledge background for the game, so several levels of difficulties are provided, so this software will be suitable for the public and the basic tutorial is provided if needed.
\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
The product should re-size and re-allocate itself according to the different size of the dialogue box. The users can re-size the dialogue box as they wish, and the game should always be in the middle of the dialogue box and with the size of three-quarters of the dialogue box. \newline
Also, the project must be the re-implementation of the classic minesweeper game, which is an open-source project that was written in Java. We will need to implement a project wrote in python that has similar functionality as the classic minesweeper game.\newline

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
The game will require the user to download ahead, and it will be a stand-alone game. The user can play the game locally on their computer.
\subsubsection{Partner of Collaborative Applications}
The product references to the classic Microsoft Minesweeper game, and the product is based on open source minesweeper codes which are written in Java.  Furthermore, the product will be written in Python and pygame will be the collaborative application.
\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
For the product to be executed the following off-the-shelf software is required:\\\\
a)Python(available from https://www.python.org)\\
\\
b)A client where the interface can run
\subsubsection{Anticipated Work-space Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment for the product is anywhere. It can be played at any time, anywhere as you want, as long as you have the game downloaded before. It is an off-line application.
\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
The is no such a schedule constraint for our team. The basic deadline is about the beginning of December when we need to present our project.
\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget for the whole project is $\$0$.
\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The game can be downloaded to local and it is free and easy to play, only with some logic.
\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional Requirement: Describe what services the software-to-be should provide
    \item Non-function Requirement: Constrain how such services should be provided
    \item Client: The group of people will provide their expectations on the product.

    \item Stakeholder: A person, group or organization that has interest or concern in the success of the project.
    \item User: The person who will eventually use the final product.
    \item  Minesweeper: The name of the classic game, which we will re-implement on
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
The relevant fact is that the original implementation of this game contains about 1200 lines of code, and it needs to run on a web browser.
\subsubsection{Business Rules}
We need to work together at the same time like in the office and try to make the same effort for this project.
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The project is developed for a single user, it can be run on a laptop or computer at any location because it is offline software. The project is not a large software, it does not have any requirements on CPU or memory for modern computers.
